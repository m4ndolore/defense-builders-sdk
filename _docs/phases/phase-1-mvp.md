### Risk: Payment processing delays
**Mitigation**: Use Stripe Connect for faster onboarding

### Risk: TAK Server licensing
**Mitigation**: Start with evaluation version, clarify licensing early

### Risk: Environment security
**Mitigation**: Network isolation, time-based access, activity monitoring
