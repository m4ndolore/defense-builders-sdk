Multi-tenant Architecture Pattern: Each customer/agency could have isolated environments with their own subdomains
Edge Infrastructure: Fast global delivery of SDK resources and documentation
Security Foundation: SSL/TLS encryption and DDoS protection for your marketplace platform

What You'll Need to Build Beyond Vercel:

Environment Orchestration Layer:

Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker) for spinning up isolated dev environments
SDK version management and dependency resolution
Resource allocation and quota management per tenant


Defense-Specific Requirements:

Compliance: FedRAMP, ITAR, or other defense compliance frameworks
Air-gapped deployment options: Many defense clients need on-premise or classified network deployments
Authentication: CAC/PIV card integration, SAML/OAuth for defense identity providers


SDK-Specific Features:

API gateway for SDK access control
Development environment templates (VS Code Server, Jupyter, etc.)
Integration sandboxes for TAK servers, Palantir Foundry instances
SDK documentation and example code hosting


Marketplace Functionality:

Billing/licensing management for different SDK tiers
Usage metering and analytics
Developer onboarding workflows



Recommended Architecture:
Consider Vercel as your frontend platform for the marketplace portal, documentation, and developer dashboard, while using specialized infrastructure for the actual SDK environments:

Frontend (Vercel): Marketplace UI, documentation, developer portal
Backend Services: AWS GovCloud/Azure Government for compute, with Kubernetes for environment orchestration
SDK Delivery: Container registries, artifact repositories, API gateways
